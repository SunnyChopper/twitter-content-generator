This is the conclusion I'm coming to as well. For very specific tasks, you can fine tune a model to do it extremely well. Piece by piece, start semi or fully automating workflows.\",\"Working on a tool that basically does this with the GPT API. Extract linguistic and stylistic traits and topics from tweets, analyze competition, figure out what type of content is working, etc.\\n\\nSuper excited to finish this week and do a trial run of it.\",\"Never know what you'll go viral for on this platform. Just have to keep learning and sometimes repeat yourself a bit haha\",\"Try reading with the assistance of an LLM this time. I bet you could read a book in a few days with its help. \\n\\nEspecially the Claude model by @AnthropicAI which can handle a 100k context. You can put entire chapters and get summarized notes, ask questions, etc.\",\"The amount of game character sprites you can make now üò¨ there's no reason for not generating game art to prototype a game with.\",\"Absolutely fascinating! I couldn't agree more, the potential of LLM in web scraping is incredibly promising.\\n\\nCombining @AnthropicAI and @LangChainAI can revolutionize data extraction, easing the process with Langchain while maximizing the output with Claude.\",\"Seeing GPT4's progress in understanding nuance is pretty amazing.\\n\\nHowever, training a specific model isn't trivial.  Do you recommend any tools/scripts for faster and more efficient labeling? Would code interpreter help here?\",\"Have we truly reached a point where a machine can learn and emulate functionality by studying documentation alone?\\n\\nIt's phenomenal the way AI is evolving ü§Ø\",\"Great point! Some may undervalue their knowledge, thinking it's too basic. Yet, for someone else, it can serve as a valuable breakthrough!\\n\\nRemember, what's basic for you can be advanced for someone starting their journey. üòä\"],\"avatar\":{},\"feedback\":{\"acceptedReplyIdeas\":[],\"rejectedReplyIdeas\":[]}}",
